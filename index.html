<p><em>Berni</em></p>
<p>35% of grade-school students ages nine and up do not understand mixed emotions, a knowledge central to social emotional development.</p>
<ul>This presents instructional challenges:
<br>
<li>How does one explain a complex emotion such as ambivalence to a child?</li>
<li>Is it more that children have trouble understanding mixed emotions, or that they have trouble articulating and comprehending mixed emotions through discussion?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> Multi-touch surfaces afford precise manipulation and creation of digital shapes for 3D production. But, to instructional technologies, how is this an affordance in the larger sense of the word?</p>
<p> In the past, researchers have often used verbal interviews as a primary method of assessing a child's understanding of instances when a peer might feel mixed emotions, such as bittersweet.</p>
<p>However, very little research has considered whether or not verbal/written language is the most effective form of communicating and evaluating mixed emotion perception.</p>
<p> Rather than leaning on a child's verbal aptitude, we believe multi-touch surface enable children to express the recognition of a character’s mixed feelings in a narrative storyline by creating sub-symbolic, virtual shapes representing their comprehension.</p>
<p>The use of artifacts as explanation and the ease of communicating nuance with visual metaphors provides for a lower-level expression/recognition of mixed emotions such as ambivalence.</p>
<p>What all of this means is that shape can represent emotion at a sub-symbolic level, operating below the level of language. This provides an alternative means to assess and develop Emotional Literacy through shape, and avoid many of the issues that commonly befall other interventions which rely heavily upon a child’s ability to verbally express her or his feelings.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, Berni is an iPad and Surface application. To our users, Berni is multi-touch virtual artifact construction tool that allows users to make 3D embodied shapes that represent their perceived emotions of others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a prudent question remains: how is this better than Play-Doh? Is it just shinier?</p>
<p><strong>Cost/Reusability:</strong> Although the purchase of a multi-touch device such as a tablet is initially expensive, it is a one time purchase and EmotionSense can be used over and over again. On the other hand, clay may not be initially expensive to buy, but it requires multiple purchases as the clay becomes unusable after several sessions. Over time this can become more expensive than the cost of a tablet when dealing with a large number of children.</p>
<p><strong>Permanence/Portability:</strong> Artifacts created by EmotionSense are digital in nature and therefore easy to maintain, copy, and transfer. This allows the user to keep a permanent copy of their work, send a copy to anyone they desire, and enables EmotionSense to keep a copy for research/future reference. The copy can even contain information about the order of manipulations that formed it. It is even possible to create a physical version of the artifact through the use of 3D printers. Unfortunately, clay does not have the same attributes. There is only one instance of the artifact and nothing can be done if it is accidentally broken.</p>
<p><strong>Space:</strong> Because the object is manipulated in a virtual environment, the space needed for construction is minimal. Clay, however, requires a great deal more space and tools to properly manipulate.</p>
<p><strong>Precision:</strong> Without prior experience and formal training, clay is difficult to manipulate with exact precision. However, EmotionSense allows users to precisely select a point on the shape that they would like to manipulate, and control how that point is extruded with a high degree of granularity.</p>
<p><strong>Mess:</strong>Working with any kind of clay is messy. By virtually abstracting the clay, EmotionSense removes the need for cleanup or a change of clothes.</p>
